Codemagic is able to detect multiple projects in a repository provided that each project has its `pubspec.yaml` file.

The first build is run for the project whose `pubspec.yaml` file was found first. After the first build, you can select the project for building from the **Project file path** dropdown in the Build section of app settings.
